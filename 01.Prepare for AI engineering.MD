# Prepare for AI engineering

## Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure

### Define AI
* AI is increasingly prevalent in the software applications we use every day; including digital assistants in our homes and cellphones, automotive technology in the vehicles that take us to work, and smart productivity applications that help us do our jobs when we get there.
* So what actually is artificial intelligence? AI as software that exhibits one or more human-like capabilities, as shown in the following table:

	| Capability | Description |
	| -- | -- |
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/visual-perception.png" height=75 width=75> | <b>Visual perception</b> - The ability to use computer vision capabilities to accept, interpret, and process input from images, video streams, and live cameras.|
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/text.png" height=75 width=75> | <b>Text analysis</b> - The ability to use natural language processing (NLP) to not only "read", but also extract semantic meaning from text-based data.
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/speech.png" height=75 width=75>	| <b>Speech</b> - The ability to recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's become known as conversational AI, in which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as bots) in much the same way they would with another human.|
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/decision-support.png" height=75 width=75>	| <b>Decision making</b> - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions. For example, recognizing anomalies in sensor readings and taking automated action to prevent failure or system damage.|
