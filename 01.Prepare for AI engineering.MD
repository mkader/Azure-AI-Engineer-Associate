# Prepare for AI engineering

## Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure

### Define AI
* AI is increasingly prevalent in the software applications we use every day; including digital assistants in our homes and cellphones, automotive technology in the vehicles that take us to work, and smart productivity applications that help us do our jobs when we get there.
* So what actually is artificial intelligence? AI as software that exhibits one or more human-like capabilities, as shown in the following table:

	| Capability | Description |
	| -- | -- |
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/visual-perception.png" height=75 width=75> | <b>Visual perception</b> - The ability to use computer vision capabilities to accept, interpret, and process input from images, video streams, and live cameras.|
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/text.png" height=75 width=75> | <b>Text analysis</b> - The ability to use natural language processing (NLP) to not only "read", but also extract semantic meaning from text-based data.
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/speech.png" height=75 width=75>	| <b>Speech</b> - The ability to recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's become known as conversational AI, in which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as bots) in much the same way they would with another human.|
	| <img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/decision-support.png" height=75 width=75>	| <b>Decision making</b> - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions. For example, recognizing anomalies in sensor readings and taking automated action to prevent failure or system damage.|

### Understand AI-related terms

* Data science - Focuses on the processing and analysis of data; applying statistical techniques to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in the data, and defining experimental models that help explore those patterns. Example
	1. a data scientist collect data about the population of an endangered species in a geographical area, and combine it with data about levels of industrialization and economic demographics in the same area. 
	1. The data can then be analyzed, using statistical techniques to extrapolate from the samples to understand trends and relationships between human activities and wildlife, and test hypotheses using models that show the likely impact of human activity on the wildlife population. 
	1. By doing so, the data scientists may help determine optimal policies that balance the need for economic wellbeing for the human population with the need for conservation of the endangered wildlife.

* Machine learning - It's a subset of data science that deals with the training and validation of predictive models. 
	1. Typically, a data scientist prepares the data and then uses it to train a model based on an algorithm that exploits the relationships between the features in the data to predict values for unknown labels. Example
	1. a data scientist use collected data to train a model that predicts the annual growth or decline in population of a species based on factors such as the number of nesting sites observed, the area of land designated as protected, the human population in the local area, the daily volume of traffic on local roads, and so on. 
	1. This predictive model can then be used as a tool to evaluate plans for housing, infrastructure, and industrial development in the local area and assess their likely impact on the local wildlife.

* Artificial intelligence - usually (but not always) builds on ML to create software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence. Example
	1. Balancing the need for wildlife conservation against economic development requires accurate monitoring of the population of the endangered species being protected. 
	1. It may not be feasible to rely on human experts who can positively identify the animal in question, or to monitor a large area over a sufficient period of time to get an accurate count. 
	1. Indeed, the presence of human observers may deter animals and prevent their detection. 
	1. In this case, a predictive model could be trained to analyze image data taken by motion-activated cameras in remote locations, and predict whether a photograph contains a sighting of the animal. 
	1. The model could then be used in a software application that responds to automated identification of animals to track animal sightings across a large geographical area, identifying areas with dense animal populations that may be candidates for protected status.

### Understand considerations for AI Engineers
	1. Model training and inferencing 
		* After the model has been trained, submit new data that includes known feature values and have the model predict the most likely label. Using the model to make predictions is referred to as inferencing.
	1. Probability and confidence scores
		* The predictions made by ML models are based on probability. Predictions have an associated confidence score that reflects the probability on which the prediction is being made. 
		* Developers should make use of confidence score values to evaluate predictions and apply appropriate thresholds to optimize application reliability.
	1. Responsible AI and ethics
