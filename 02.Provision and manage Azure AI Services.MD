## [Create and consume Azure AI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-cognitive-services/)

### Provision an Azure AI Services resource
* Use any of the AI Services, create Azuew resources to define an endpoint where the service can be consumed, provide access keys for authenticated access, and to manage billing for your application's usage of the service.
* Options for Azure resources
  1. Multi-service resource
     * You can provision an AI Services resource that supports multiple different AI Services. For example, create a single resource that enables you to use the AI Language, AI Vision, AI Speech, and other services.
     * Manage a single set of access credentials to consume multiple services at a single endpoint, and with a single point of billing for usage of all services.
  1. Single-service resource
     * Each AI service can be provisioned individually, for example by creating discrete AI Language and AI Vision resources in your Azure subscription.
     * Use separate endpoints for each service. Manage access credentials and  for each service independently
     * Single-service resources generally offer a free tier (with usage restrictions), making them a good choice to try out a service before using it in a production application.
  1. Training and prediction resources
     * While most Azure AI Services can be used through a single Azure resource, some offer (or require) separate resources for model training and prediction. 
     * Manage billing for training custom models separately from model consumption by applications, and in most cases enables you to use a dedicated service-specific resource to train a model, but a generic Azure AI Services resource to make the model available to applications for inferencing.
