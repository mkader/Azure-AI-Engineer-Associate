## [Extract insights from text with the Azure AI Language service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/extract-insights-text-with-text-analytics-service/)

### Provision an Azure AI Language resource
  * The Azure AI Language service is designed to help you extract information from text. It provides functionality that you can use for:
    1. Language detection - determining the language in which text is written.
    1. Key phrase extraction - identifying important words and phrases in the text that indicate the main points.
    1. Sentiment analysis - quantifying how positive or negative the text is.
    1. Named entity recognition - detecting references to entities, including people, locations, time periods, organizations, and more.
    1. Entity linking - identifying specific entities by providing reference links to Wikipedia articles.

### Detect language
* The Azure AI Language Detection API evaluates text input and, for each document submitted, returns language identifiers with a score indicating the strength of the analysis. 
* The Azure AI Language service recognizes up to 120 languages.
* Another scenario could involve a chat bot - Language detection can be used to determine which language they are using and allow you to configure your bot responses in the appropriate language.
* You can parse the results of this analysis to determine which language is used in the input document. The response also returns a score, which reflects the confidence of the model (a value between 0 and 1).
* Language detection can work with documents or single phrases. 
* the document size must be under 5,120 characters. The size limit is per document and each collection is restricted to 1,000 items (IDs). 
* A sample JSON, including a collection of documents, each containing a unique id and the text to be analyzed. Optionally, you can provide a countryHint to improve prediction performance.

'''
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "countryHint": "US",
      "id": "1",
      "text": "Hello world"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "text": "Bonjour tout le monde"
    }
  ]
}
'''
The service will return a JSON response that contains a result for each document in the request body, including the predicted language and a value indicating the confidence level of the prediction. The confidence level is a value ranging from 0 to 1 with values closer to 1 being a higher confidence level. Here's an example of a standard JSON response that maps to the above request JSON.

JSON

Copy
{
  "documents": [
   {
     "id": "1",
     "detectedLanguage": {
       "name": "English",
       "iso6391Name": "en",
       "confidenceScore": 1
     },
     "warnings": []
   },
   {
     "id": "2",
     "detectedLanguage": {
       "name": "French",
       "iso6391Name": "fr",
       "confidenceScore": 1
     },
     "warnings": []
   }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "modelVersion": "2020-04-01"
}
In our sample, all of the languages show a confidence of 1, mostly because the text is relatively simple and easy to identify the language for.

If you pass in a document that has multilingual content, the service will behave a bit differently. Mixed language content within the same document returns the language with the largest representation in the content, but with a lower positive rating, reflecting the marginal strength of that assessment. In the following example, the input is a blend of English, Spanish, and French. The analyzer uses statistical analysis of the text to determine the predominant language.

JSON

Copy
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. ¿Se ofrecen clases en español? Es mi primera lengua y más fácil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en français?"
    }
  ]
}
The following sample shows a response for this multi-language example.

JSON

Copy
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "detectedLanguages": [
        {
          "name": "Spanish",
          "iso6391Name": "es",
          "score": 0.9375
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
The last condition to consider is when there is ambiguity as to the language content. The scenario might happen if you submit textual content that the analyzer is not able to parse, for example because of character encoding issues when converting the text to a string variable. As a result, the response for the language name and ISO code will indicate (unknown) and the score value will be returned as NaN, or Not a Number. The following example shows how the response would look.

JSON

Copy
{
      "id": "5",
      "detectedLanguages": [
        {
          "name": "(Unknown)",
          "iso6391Name": "(Unknown)",
          "score": "NaN"
        }
      ]

 Note

The code examples in the subsequent units in this module show the JSON requests and responses exchanged with the REST interface. When using an SDK, the JSON requests are abstracted by appropriate objects and methods that encapsulate the same data values. You'll get a chance to try the SDK for C# or Python for yourself in the exercise later in the module.
